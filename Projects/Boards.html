        Program Objectives for Game Programming.
    </h1>
        <!--I seperated each with p so that it would be spaced, it was a block of text.-->
<p>
    1. Implement multiple completed games, including 3D games, using common tools, languages and software for web,
    console, PC or mobile platforms.
</p>
        <!--So, how are you doing today?-->
<p>
    2. Design, develop and implement the architecture and infrastructure needed to support a complete game project.
</p>
        <!--Have you hydrated; ate a meal?-->
<p>
    3. Implement and analyze fundamental data structures and algorithms associated with game applications supporting
    gameplay mechanics.
</p>
        <!--A real meal, not some microwave dinner. You deserve something nice to eat.-->
<p>
    4. Use software development processes to analyze a project problem and to design, build and test a corresponding software
    solution.
</p>
        <!--These spaces are so that reading isn't horrible.-->
<p>
    5. Demonstrate development skills using multiple programming languages, development environments and platforms,
    including advanced and/or experimental topics in game programming.
</p>
        <!--These comments are so your body and mental state isn't horrible.-->
<p>
    6. Establish collaboration, mentorship and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly
    polished and completed projects
</p>
        <!--Take some 'me' time, okay?-->
<h2>
    Courses in Game Programming will emphasize the essential issues and the skills required to develop games for multiple video
game platforms such as PC, console, mobile, online and virtual reality. These skills have broader applications in related
industries such as entertainment, business, research and training. Game Programming students begin with the programming
principles, skills and techniques shared in all programming disciplines, and then focus on game-specific features and
techniques. This degree emphasizes C++ programming, C# programming, scripting, data handling, gameplay interaction,
artificial intelligence, networking and the use of industry-standard middleware, game engines, and APIs. Students in the
Game Programming major will also develop a critical approach to the study of gameplay, interaction and design.
